# Monorepo Dependency Management Rule

This project contains two separate `package.json` files:
- [deliveroo-backend/package.json](mdc:deliveroo-backend/package.json)
- @deliveroo-frontend/package.json

**When adding, removing, or updating dependencies:**
- Always ensure you are in the correct directory (`deliveroo-backend` or `feliveroo-frontend`) before running any package manager commands (e.g., `npm install`, `yarn add`).
- Only modify the `package.json` file relevant to the part of the project you are working on.
- Do not make changes to both `package.json` files unless explicitly instructed to do so.

This ensures that backend and frontend dependencies remain isolated and correctly managed.
